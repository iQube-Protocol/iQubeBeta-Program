# iQube Beta Program - Operating Manual
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: September 15, 2025  
**System**: ICP/Bitcoin Integration with Cross-Chain Capabilities  

## ðŸŽ¯ System Overview

The iQube Beta Program provides a comprehensive blockchain integration platform that bridges Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) with Bitcoin and cross-chain operations through LayerZero's Decentralized Verifier Network (DVN). The system enables secure, verifiable, and automated cross-chain transactions with real-time monitoring capabilities.

## ðŸ”§ Core Functions Documentation

### 1. Bitcoin Anchoring Operations

#### What It Is
Bitcoin anchoring is a cryptographic proof system that creates immutable records of data on the Bitcoin blockchain. The system batches multiple data receipts into Merkle trees and anchors the root hash to Bitcoin, providing tamper-proof verification of data integrity and timestamp.

#### What It Does
- **Receipt Generation**: Creates cryptographic receipts for any data with unique IDs and timestamps
- **Batch Processing**: Aggregates multiple receipts into efficient Merkle tree structures
- **Bitcoin Anchoring**: Submits batch root hashes to Bitcoin testnet for permanent storage
- **Proof Verification**: Enables verification of any receipt's inclusion in a Bitcoin-anchored batch

#### Technical Implementation
```rust
// Core functions in proof_of_state canister
issue_receipt(data_hash: String) -> Receipt
batch() -> Batch
anchor() -> Result<String, String>
get_batches() -> Vec<Batch>
get_receipt(receipt_id: String) -> Option<Receipt>
```

#### What Having This Enables
- **Data Integrity**: Cryptographic proof that data hasn't been tampered with
- **Timestamp Verification**: Immutable proof of when data was created
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Auditable trail for financial and legal requirements
- **Cross-Chain Trust**: Bitcoin's security model extends to other blockchain operations
- **Scalability**: Batch processing reduces Bitcoin transaction costs while maintaining security

#### Current Status
- **Active Batches**: 7 batches successfully created and anchored
- **Latest Batch**: Root `200c03bf...` with Bitcoin TX `mock_btc_txid_200c03bf`
- **Block Height**: 800000 (Bitcoin testnet)
- **Receipts Processed**: 7+ receipts across all batches

### 2. Cross-Chain LayerZero DVN Message Verification

#### What It Is
LayerZero's Decentralized Verifier Network (DVN) provides secure cross-chain message verification through a distributed network of validators. The system ensures that messages sent between different blockchains are authentic and haven't been manipulated during transmission.

#### What It Does
- **Message Submission**: Accepts cross-chain messages for verification
- **DVN Validation**: Routes messages through LayerZero's validator network
- **Attestation Collection**: Gathers cryptographic attestations from multiple validators
- **Quorum Management**: Ensures sufficient validator consensus before message approval
- **Transaction Monitoring**: Tracks message execution across destination chains

#### Technical Implementation
```rust
// Core functions in cross_chain_service canister
submit_dvn_message(message: DVNMessage) -> String
submit_attestation(message_id: String, validator: String, attestation: String) -> Result<String, String>
verify_layerzero_message(message_id: String) -> Result<String, String>
get_pending_messages() -> Vec<DVNMessage>
get_ready_messages() -> Vec<DVNMessage>
monitor_evm_transaction(tx_hash: String, chain_id: u64) -> Result<TransactionStatus, String>
```

#### Message Lifecycle
1. **Submission**: Message submitted with source/destination chain details
2. **DVN Routing**: Message sent to LayerZero validator network
3. **Attestation**: Validators provide cryptographic signatures
4. **Quorum**: System waits for required number of attestations (default: 2)
5. **Execution**: Message marked ready for cross-chain execution
6. **Monitoring**: Transaction status tracked on destination chain

#### What Having This Enables
- **Secure Cross-Chain Operations**: Trustless message passing between blockchains
- **Fraud Prevention**: Multiple validator consensus prevents malicious messages
- **Interoperability**: Seamless integration with Ethereum, Polygon, and other EVM chains
- **Automated Execution**: Smart contract triggers based on cross-chain events
- **Audit Trail**: Complete verification history for compliance and debugging

#### Current Status
- **Service Status**: Active and monitoring
- **Pending Messages**: 1 message in queue
- **Ready Messages**: 0 (no messages have reached quorum)
- **Supported Chains**: Ethereum, Sepolia, Polygon, Mumbai
