# iQube Protocol Operations Manual

Welcome to the comprehensive operations manual for the iQube Protocol - a revolutionary decentralized AI agent framework that integrates advanced contextual intelligence, blockchain-backed state management, and tokenized information access.

## What is the iQube Protocol?

The iQube Protocol introduces a new class of context and risk intelligent agents underpinned by verifiable decentralized information assets called **iQubes**. Our mission is to create an agent ecosystem that prioritizes:

- **Comprehensive risk and value analysis**
- **Dynamic semantic context generation** 
- **Secure and verifiable data interactions**

## Core Architecture

The protocol operates on a three-layer architectural model:

### 1. Context Layer
- Driven by iQube and BlakQube content
- Dynamic context generation and RAG
- Web search and information aggregation

### 2. Service Layer  
- API integration and service discovery
- Wallet and blockchain interactions
- CRUD operations management

### 3. State Layer
- Blockchain-backed state persistence
- Immutable transaction logging
- Agent memory management

## iQube Components

### Primitives
1. **MetaQube**: Public, verifiable metadata
2. **BlakQube**: Private, encrypted data  
3. **TokenQube**: Token-gated data decryption and access

### Types
1. **DataQube**: Alpha-numeric data representation
2. **ContentQube**: Multi-modal content (blob) representation
3. **AgentQube**: AI agent performance and compliance tracking

## ðŸš€ Current Applications

### Aigent Z (`apps/aigent-z/`)
Unified intelligence agent platform with:
- Multi-mode iQube operations (View, Use, Edit, Decrypt, Mint, Activate)
- Registry management with Library and Registry visibility controls
- Network Operations console for live blockchain monitoring
- AI personas and context transformation

### Network Operations (Integrated)
Real-time monitoring and diagnostics integrated within Aigent Z:
- Live testnet integration (Ethereum Sepolia, Polygon Amoy)
- ICP canister health monitoring
- Cross-chain DVN message processing
- System testing and validation
- Accessible via Settings â†’ Network Ops

### Additional Applications
- **Ops Console** (`apps/ops-console/`): Standalone operations monitoring
- **21 Sats Market** (`apps/21sats-market/`): Bitcoin marketplace application

## Who This Manual Is For

### Business Users
- **Registry Operations**: Browse, mint, and manage iQubes
- **Agent Interactions**: Work with AI personas and context transformation
- **Monitoring**: Use Network Ops for system health oversight

### Technical Developers
- **Integration**: Connect with ICP canisters and blockchain networks
- **Development**: Build on the protocol stack
- **Operations**: Deploy, monitor, and maintain systems

### System Operators
- **Monitoring**: Real-time system health and diagnostics
- **Troubleshooting**: Identify and resolve issues
- **Maintenance**: Keep systems running optimally

## Manual Structure

This manual is organized into logical sections that build upon each other:

- **Getting Started**: Quick setup and basic concepts
- **User Operations**: Day-to-day usage of applications
- **System Operations**: Monitoring, testing, and maintenance
- **Technical Architecture**: Deep dive into system design
- **Integration Guide**: Connect external systems and services
- **Development**: Build and deploy on the protocol
- **Reference**: APIs, configuration, and glossary

## Live Integration Status

The protocol currently features **live testnet integration** with:

- **Ethereum Sepolia**: Live RPC monitoring via Infura
- **Polygon Amoy**: Live RPC monitoring via official endpoints  
- **ICP Canisters**: Real-time canister health and cross-chain services
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive validation and diagnostics

**No mock or demonstration data** - all monitoring uses live testnet data from real blockchain networks and deployed ICP canisters.

## Quick Start
