# Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for key terms, concepts, and technologies used throughout the iQube Protocol and its documentation.

## Core Concepts

### iQube
A decentralized information asset that combines public metadata (MetaQube), private encrypted data (BlakQube), and access control mechanisms (TokenQube). iQubes serve as the fundamental unit of information in the protocol.

### MetaQube
The public, verifiable metadata component of an iQube. Contains information such as:
- Basic identification (name, creator, type)
- Scoring metrics (sensitivity, accuracy, verifiability, risk)
- Business model and pricing information
- Ownership and visibility settings

### BlakQube
The private, encrypted data component of an iQube. Contains sensitive or proprietary information that requires access control and decryption capabilities to view.

### TokenQube
The access control component that manages permissions for BlakQube data. Implements token-gated decryption and time-limited access grants through capability tokens.

## iQube Types

### DataQube
An iQube designed for alpha-numeric data representation, such as structured datasets, configuration files, or database records.

### ContentQube
An iQube designed for multi-modal content (blob) representation, including images, videos, documents, and other binary data.

### AgentQube
An iQube designed for AI agent performance and compliance tracking, containing agent behavior logs, performance metrics, and compliance records.

### ToolQube
An iQube containing tools, utilities, or software components that can be executed or integrated into other systems.

### ModelQube
An iQube containing machine learning models, training data, or AI-related assets.

## Operational Modes

### View Mode
A read-only operational mode for browsing and inspecting iQube metadata and structure without the ability to make modifications.

### Use Mode
An operational mode for creating instances from existing templates with controlled editing capabilities, maintaining template integrity while allowing customization.

### Edit Mode
A full editing mode that provides complete customization capabilities for creating and modifying iQube templates with dynamic field management.

### Decrypt Mode
A secure operational mode for accessing encrypted BlakQube data with proper authorization and capability token validation.

### Mint Mode
An operational mode for converting completed iQube templates into blockchain-backed instances with permanent, immutable registration.

### Activate Mode
An operational mode for enabling iQube functionality using secure activation codes, typically used for purchased or licensed iQubes.

## Visibility and Privacy

### Library (Private)
A local storage mechanism where iQubes are saved privately in the user's browser using localStorage. These iQubes are not visible to other users and exist only on the local device.

### Registry (Public)
A server-side storage mechanism where iQubes are publicly visible and discoverable by all users. Public registry iQubes can be viewed, forked, and used by anyone.

### Registry (Private)
A server-side storage mechanism where iQubes are stored on the server but visible only to the owner. These can potentially be activated to public status later.

### Template
A reusable iQube structure that defines fields, validation rules, and default values. Templates serve as blueprints for creating multiple instances.

### Instance
A specific implementation of a template with populated data fields. Instances maintain a relationship to their source template while allowing independent modifications.

## Blockchain and Technical Terms

### ICP (Internet Computer Protocol)
A blockchain network that hosts smart contracts (canisters) and provides decentralized computation capabilities. The iQube Protocol uses ICP for canister-based services.

### Canister
A smart contract on the Internet Computer Protocol that can store data and execute code. The iQube Protocol uses multiple canisters for different functions:
- proof_of_state: Receipt generation and anchoring
- btc_signer_psbt: Bitcoin transaction signing
- cross_chain_service: Cross-chain messaging
- evm_rpc: EVM chain interactions

### DVN (Decentralized Verifier Network)
A component of LayerZero protocol that provides decentralized message verification for cross-chain communications.

### Threshold ECDSA
A cryptographic technique that distributes private key operations across multiple parties, requiring a threshold number of participants to create signatures.

### PSBT (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction)
A Bitcoin standard for transactions that can be signed by multiple parties or devices, enabling complex multi-signature workflows.

### RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
A protocol that allows programs to execute procedures on remote systems. Used for blockchain interactions via endpoints like Infura or official network RPCs.

## Scoring and Assessment

### Sensitivity Score
A metric (1-10 scale) indicating how sensitive or private the data in an iQube is, with higher scores indicating more sensitive information.

### Accuracy Score
A metric (1-10 scale) indicating the accuracy and reliability of the data in an iQube, with higher scores indicating more accurate information.

### Verifiability Score
A metric (1-10 scale) indicating how easily the data in an iQube can be verified or validated, with higher scores indicating more verifiable information.

### Risk Score
A metric (1-10 scale) indicating the potential risk associated with using or sharing the iQube data, with higher scores indicating higher risk.

### Trust Score
A calculated composite metric derived from other scores that indicates the overall trustworthiness of an iQube.

### Reliability Index
A calculated composite metric that indicates the overall reliability and dependability of an iQube based on multiple factors.

## Business and Economic Terms
